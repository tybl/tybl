# Disclaimer during ongoing development

We want to discourage you from using the development version of Taskwarrior.

The development branch is a work in progress and may not pass all quality tests,
therefore it may harm your data. We do not guarantee proper or even adequate
functionality, performance or timely fixes.

We welcome bug reports from beta- and release-level software, but generally not
development versions. If you are undaunted by this, please:

- Make proper backups.
- Expect broken and missing functionality.
- Be aware that using the development branch involves risks.
