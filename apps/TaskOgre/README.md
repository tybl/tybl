# TaskOgre
This is a fork of [Taskwarrior](https://github.com/GothenburgBitFactory/taskwarrior/tree/cf45f28cc0c7259eab8ae8dbb979b9d543abea6a). If you are looking for that fantastic project, please visit [taskwarrior.org](https://taskwarrior.org/) for the project webpage.

Why did I fork Taskwarrior if it's such a venerable project? Because it doesn't *quite* meet my needs. I realize Taskwarrior is highly customizable through configuration files, but it just feels more fun to do it this way! Also, I want to play with the latest tools and familiarize myself with current best practices. How can you do all that without having a toy project to do that with?

That's right, I called this a toy project. Please don't feel like, since it is based on Taskwarrior, it will have any of the same reliability. I can only aspire to get it there someday.
